# XapperLoader

XapperLoader is the Unoffical loadstring loader with support for both exploits. (KRNL and S^X)



## Loadstring

Run this loadstring in your exploit and it should load!

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobloxArchiver/Xapper-Addon-Loader/main/Utility/XapperLoader.lua", true))()
```

# AutoXapper

AutoXapper is a autoexec script meant to launch Booga Xapper for you. This can be done in two different ways. 
## Install

The first guide is simple and requires minimal work. 

### Simple Install

The simple install requires minimal work, lets begin. 

Locate your exploits autoexec folder then create a file inside it named whatever, for simplicity I will name it "AutoXapper.lua" and make sure it is saved with the .lua extension. 

Next copy the script from the Utility folder on the github, then paste it into "AutoXapper.lua" and save. You are ready to go!

### Nosploit Install (SYNAPSE ONLY)

It gained the name Nosploit for not needing Synapse to be open to run. 

First head into Synapse settings, and enable these two options: Auto-Launch and Internal UI 

Next do everything above

Close Synapse

Load into a game of Booga, then Xapper should load. You can also click Insert to have access to an executer, aka Synapse's Internal UI.
# Code Copies

There are 2 copies of Xapper's code, The KRNL version and Synapse Version. They are both archived here.

# XapperAdder (SYNAPSE ONLY)

Xapper added is a WORK IN PROGRESS addon-manager for Xapper, meant to add more features to it for free! But of course you have to own Xapper and Synapse.
